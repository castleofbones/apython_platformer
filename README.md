# A Python Platformer

A simple platformer game built with Python and Pygame, using AntiGravity and Gemini and the code monkeys.

This idea came about when I was bored one evening and contemplating turning my old Raspberry Pi 3B into a homebrew retro game console.  Instead I decided to start trying to find the art of the possible an IDE and an AI coding assistant.  With the exception of this introduction, the code is all generated by Gemini.

But remember, this is not a serious project, I mean take one too and the thing you be yelling that your kid has better games on their Tomy (is that still a thing?) but I dont care.  I just want to have fun.  It's rubbish but it's my rubbish!

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/castleofbones/apython_platformer.git
    cd apython_platformer

2.  Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
